                            Water supply continues to be a major problem in rural areas and as such we engage
                            contractors in drilling boreholes in all street quarters of Osi- Ekiti, Ekiti State and
                            neighboring communities like Igbole-Ekiti and Awo-Ekiti.
                            We have commissioned a total of 11 boreholes around 20 villages and communities to
                            compliment their supply of clean drinking water.

                            Side road clearing is also a major part of our contribution to the community , the safety of
                            commuters on our road cannot be overemphasized thus maintaining a good road network was part
                            of our activities this we believe will reduce the rate of auto crash and also reduce the
                            activities of criminal element on the highway due to overgrown shrub on both sides of the
                            road.

                            Mercy International Mission also hopes to partner with local and international organizations
                            such as the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) to bring agricultural
                            projects to Osi- Ekiti and surrounding communities . The aim of this project is to provide
                            jobs, food sufficiency and commerce for the local communities.

        In addition to our main vision of providing access to basic medical care
        services, Mercy International Mission is also contributing to the development of the host village,
        Osi-Ekiti. Via our voluntary community service initiative, the youths in Osi Ekiti are mobilized as
        the need arises to undertake maintenance work on community utilities. Some of the features of the
        initiative includes: cutting of grasses in public squares, cleaning of the town hall, doing
        palliative repair works on community roads among others. We hope to replicate this in all or most of
        the villages within our coverage zone in the coming years. We also continued to support the women
        and youth that received small micro loans from Mercy International, helping them to address various
        challenges facing them. TESTIMONIALS We have several testimonies of what Mercy International meant
        for the people of Nigeria and what it has done for individuals within the community. To mention just
        a few, during Aramoko-Ekiti outreach, an old woman suffering from Osteoarthritis to the extent that
        she was unable to walk was treated and given medication by the mobile clinic team for few weeks. At
        some point, a call was received from her children that she can now walk without pain. Also, a
        patient was rushed to the clinic with history of diarrhea for about three days and was very weak and
        dehydrated. After being assessed he came up with hypotension and was placed on intravenous fluid
        normal saline and dextrose water with some other drugs. He regained his strength after administering
        the medications. A 65 years old man with a swollen leg and a deep injury was brought to the clinic
        on the 21st of August 2018. His leg wound was extremely severe, to the extent that he could not walk
        without significant assistance. Mercy International Mission staff treated him, beginning with an
        incision and drainage to the wound site, as it was large and septic. After this, they began a
        regimen of daily dressing with topical antibiotics and honey. The wound healed after (3) three
        months of treatment. </p>

                            <p>We launched our short term medical mission in February of 2012, when a team of five Mercy
                                International Mission representatives and healthcare professionals traveled from the
                                U.S. to Nigeria to join a larger group of over 30 physicians, nurses, and technicians,
                                plus other support volunteers to provide medical services to individuals who had no
                                previous access to health care, no health insurance, and no resources to obtain such
                                services. Most of our beneficiaries had been struggling with some of these underlying
                                medical issues for years without help before the advent of the medical mission.</p>
                            <p>Our Access to Care programs contains the following components:</p>

                            <p>Development of healthcare delivery in many of the small towns and villages in rural Ekiti
                                state is known to be fraught with challenges. Some of these include interrupted
                                electricity supply, water and sanitation problems, maintenance of adequate supplies of
                                pharmaceuticals and lab equipment, transportation, and human safety.</p>
                            <p>Mercy International Mission has addressed most of these issues through the various
                                projects our organization has embarked on since inception in 2007. We have served this
                                area using a 3-pronged approach which includes stationary clinics, mobile health vans,
                                and annual large-scale healthcare events. Our mobile clinic operates in Ekiti state and
                                environs, providing professional healthcare service to over 20 different towns and
                                villages.</p>
                            <p>We have also engaged the services of a telemedicine company to provide services in
                                various countries in Africa and the U.S. as well. It is our strong belief that the
                                addition of telehealth will expand our reach; however, the availability of good internet
                                connection in some parts of Africa has been our biggest challenge in achieving the
                                desired milestone but overall progress has been made on so many fronts.</p>

                        <p>The 2024 Mercy International Medical Mission was a 3-day free medical mission aimed at
                            providing comprehensive medical service to residents of Ekiti State in the southwestern part
                            of Nigeria. Areas of coverage included general consultation, free medication administration,
                            major and minor surgeries, dental inspections, cleaning, implants and extractions, eye
                            screening and subsequent provision of corrective glasses, mental counseling, hypertensive
                            and diabetic screening and management, medical consultation, and general checkups among
                            other vital medical services.</p>
                        <p>The mission was a huge success as there was a record turnout of beneficiaries and volunteers.
                            We also advised intending beneficiaries to always pre-register to help us project the number
                            of expected beneficiaries which in turn would enable us to plan adequately which will
                            consequently help us achieve optimal results in providing much-needed health care services
                            to humanity.</p>

            <h3>Patients Served During 2018 Medical Mission:</h3>
            <p>The Annual Medical Mission takes place annually over 4 days. During this event, volunteer doctors,
                nurses, and others served people from Osi-Ekiti and the 21 surrounding villages. In 2018, the annual
                medical mission took place from Sunday, September 24 through Thursday, September 27, 2018, in Osi-Ekiti,
                Ekiti State, Nigeria. Over 1,700 men, women, and children received consultations, health, eye, and
                dental care services, medications, and spiritual counseling. Each day began with prayers and health
                awareness education dealing with health issues ranging from management of hypertension and diabetes (two
                of the most common chronic non-infectious diseases in the area) to hygiene, healthy food consumption,
                etc. A different health issue was discussed each day, and patients had the opportunity to ask questions
                and seek clarifications. Mercy International Mission hosts a medical mission every year comprised of at
                least 60-75 volunteers. More than a dozen of those volunteers are from Minnesota. These volunteers range
                from doctors and surgeons to nurses and other medical professionals. Other non-medical professionals,
                including youth workers and pastors, are also invited.</p>

   

            <h3>Public Health Education/Awareness</h3>
            <p>People living in poverty usually haven't been educated about when, why, and where to access healthcare.
                Many wrongly believe that their disease is irreversible and permanent, and they are not aware of medical
                treatments that can improve or cure their condition. For example, few people in remote villages are
                aware that many of the forms of blindness prevalent in Nigeria can be cured through surgery.
                Additionally, general public health education is lacking, such as knowledge of proper hygiene and water
                treatment. In this way, a lack of education leads to the spread of disease and also prevents patients
                from seeking medical care. A lack of understanding about the origins of the disease can also lead to
                sociocultural stigmas, but we believe that the vicious triad of poverty, ignorance, and disease can be
                reversed by having doctors and nurses available to see patients regularly in a conducive environment.
                Beyond providing vital medical care, we also place deliberate emphasis on spreading the message of
                preventive medicine among our target population. In this part of the world, ignorance is a major factor
                in the spread of diseases. Our staff delivers public health lectures and training at religious and
                social gatherings to actively combat this trend.</p>
